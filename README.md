- **Tailored Games**: Enliven uses specially crafted games to stimulate cognitive development in children. These games are designed to be entertaining while also targeting specific cognitive areas, providing a fun and effective learning experience.

- **Web Platform**: The Enliven platform is built using a modern web stack, utilizing React for the user interface, MongoDB for data storage, and Express and Node.js for backend development. This technology combination ensures a responsive and seamless experience for both children and caregivers.
